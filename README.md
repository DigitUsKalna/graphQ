# graphQ 

### graphQ is a python package that helps you to fit a curve to provided data points

---

#### To install the package just type following
```pip install graphQ```

##### be careful with the spelling "graphQ"

#### Then import as following

``` import graphQ as gq```

Then use the ```auto_fit()``` function, it takes two lists as inputs, first being *X* data and the second being *Y* data. 

### so all together the code looks like...

```gq.auto_fit( [1,2,3,4,5,6]  ,  [1,4,9,16,25,36] )```

and here is the output
